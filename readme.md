Project "Leniwa Szama" is a landing page of fake diet meal delivery company. It is simple learning project. Main goal of this project was to practcie Boostrap 5.

- Finished site layout
- Used Bootstrap 5 to make most of the layout
- Used media query for #header to make responsive height for section
- Used vanilla JS to make section #opinie dynamic
